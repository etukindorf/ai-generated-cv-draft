            <p>
                Seasoned software engineer and technical leader with over 15 years of experience in building scalable, high-performance systems. Proficient in Java, Kotlin, and modern frameworks like Spring Boot and React, I have a proven track record of transforming complex legacy systems into cutting-edge microservices architectures.
                
                Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve contributed to diverse projects, from developing enterprise-grade applications for leading market companies to modernizing national lottery systems. My key achievements include successfully managing cross-functional teams and driving the migration of monolithic applications to cloud-based ecosystems while ensuring seamless scalability and robust data consistency.

                I am passionate about continuous learning, reflected in certifications such as Spring Certified Professional and Oracle Java SE 11 Developer, as well as advanced training in DDD, micro frontends, and security. Currently, I lead a team focused on integrating payment solutions and enhancing user experiences with React-based interfaces.
